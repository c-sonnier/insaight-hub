      <h2>Introduction</h2>
      <p>
        Small group health insurance in the U.S. &ndash; typically employer-sponsored benefits for small businesses &ndash; is on the cusp of major transformation. Artificial intelligence (AI) is rapidly advancing across the insurance value chain, promising to streamline operations and elevate customer service. While AI has been used for years in underwriting, claims, and service, the advent of accessible generative AI (e.g. ChatGPT) has catalyzed broader interest in everyday agency workflows.
      </p>
      <p>
        As of 2024, only 6% of independent insurance agencies had fully implemented an AI solution, but one in three agency principals plan to use AI within five years. This exploratory analysis looks ahead 3&ndash;5 years to envision how AI will reshape the work of small group benefits agents and general agencies.
      </p>
      <p>
        We'll examine how core systems &ndash; agency management platforms, quoting and renewal tools, policy management systems &ndash; may evolve, and what new tools agents will rely on to manage their business. Importantly, we will consider which tasks AI will "compress" to near-zero cost and which human roles become more valuable in an increasingly data-saturated, noisy world.

      <h2>The Small Group Benefits Ecosystem</h2>
      <p>
        In the small group health insurance market, independent agents and agencies serve as trusted advisors to small employers, helping them select and manage employee benefit plans. They often collaborate with General Agencies (GAs) &ndash; specialized intermediaries that aggregate carrier relationships, provide quoting platforms, and offer back-office support to retail agents.
      </p>
      <p>
        Today, a GA might assist an agent by supplying multi-carrier quotes, handling enrollment paperwork, and ensuring compliance with regulations like the ACA. This ecosystem is complex and traditionally paper-heavy and relationship-driven. However, rising cost pressures and client expectations for digital convenience are pushing all parties to innovate.
      </p>

      <div class="highlight-box">
        <p>
          <strong>Key Insight:</strong> General agencies are looking for ways to empower their network of agents with better technology and value-added services. The stage is set for AI-driven tools to augment (not replace) the human expertise that agents and GAs provide. Those who embrace these innovations stand to strengthen their competitive edge, while those who "stand still" risk falling behind in an AI-enhanced marketplace.
